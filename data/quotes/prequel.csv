Padme Amidala,"So this is how liberty dies...with thunderous applause"
Obi-Wan Kenobi,"You were my brother, Anakin! I loved you."
Obi-Wan Kenobi,"You were the Chosen One! You were supposed to destroy the Sith, not join them. You were supposed to bring balance to the force, not leave it in darkness."
Mace Windu,"The senate will decide your fate."
Obi-Wan Kenobi,"We're still flying half a ship!"
Count Dooku,"I sense great fear in you, Skywalker. You have hate, you have anger, but you don't use them."
Darth Sidious,"Anakin Skywalker, you are one with the Order of the Sith Lords. Henceforth, you shall be known as... Darth Vader."
Obi-Wan Kenobi,"You have allowed this Dark Lord to twist your mind until now... until now you have become the very thing you swore to destroy."
Anakin Skywalker,"Don't lecture me, Obi-Wan. I see through the lies of the Jedi. I do not fear the Dark Side as you do!"
Yoda,"Faith in your new apprentice misplaced may be - as is your faith in the dark side of the force."
Yoda,"Into exile, I must go. Failed, I have."
Anakin Skywalker,"You will not take her from me."
Obi-Wan Kenobi,"Your anger and your lust for power have already done that."
Obi-Wan Kenobi,"It's over Anakin! I have the high ground!"
Anakin Skywalker,"You underestimate my power!"
Obi-Wan Kenobi,"Don't try it..."
Anakin Skywalker,"Love can't save you. Only my new powers can."
Yoda,"The boy you trained, gone he is. Consumed by Darth Vader."
Darth Sidious,"Commander Cody, the time has come. Execute Order 66."
Yoda,"Death is a natural part of life. Rejoice for those around you who transform into the Force. Mourn them, do not. Miss them, do not. Attachment leads to jealousy. The shadow of greed, that is."
Yoda,"Train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose."
Padme Amidala,"Hold me, Ani! Hold me, like you did by the lake on Naboo!"
Obi-Wan Kenobi,"Flying is for droids."
Obi-Wan Kenobi,"Only a Sith deals in absolutes. I will do what I must."
Anakin Skywalker,"You will try."
Padme Amidala,"Obi-Wan... there... is good in him. I know there is... still..."
Yoda,"The fear of loss is a path to the Dark Side."
Padme Amidala,"I don't believe what I'm hearing... Obi-Wan was right. You've changed."
Padme Amidala,"I don't know you any more. Anakin, you're breaking my heart. I'll never stop loving you, but you are going down a path I can't follow!"
Obi-Wan Kenobi,"I have failed you, Anakin. I have failed you."
Chancellor Palpatine,"I can feel your anger. It makes you stronger!"
Padme Amidala,"What if the democracy we thought we were serving no longer exists, and the Republic has become the very evil we have been fighting to destroy?"
Chancellor Palpatine,"Remember back to your early teachings. Anakin. All those who gain power are afraid to lose it. Even the Jedi."
Chancellor Palpatine,"Good is a point of view, Anakin."
Jango Fett,"I'm just a simple man trying to make my way in the universe."
Yoda,"At an end, your rule is. And not short enough, it was."
Darth Sidious,"Unlimited power!"
Yoda,"If so powerful you are, why run?"
Obi-Wan Kenobi,"So uncivilized..."
Qui-Gon Jinn,"Remember: your focus determines your reality."
Anakin Skywalker,"Are you an angel?"
Qui-Gon Jinn,"Greed can be a very powerful ally."
Senator Palpatine,"There is no civility, only politics."
Jar Jar Binks,"Ooh moi moi! I love you!"
Jar Jar Binks,"I speck!"
Jar Jar Binks,"If me be returnin, the Bosses will do terrible things to me! Tewwwwible things!"
Shmi Skywalker,"You can't stop change any more than you can stop the suns from setting."
Padme Amidala,"I will not condone a course of action that will lead us to war."
Darth Maul,"At last we will reveal ourselves to the Jedi. At last we will have revenge."
Yoda,"Hard to see, the dark side is."
Obi-Wan Kenobi,"I have a bad feeling about this."
Yoda,"Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering. I sense much fear in you."
C-3PO,"My parts are showing? Oh, my goodness, oh!"
Darth Sidious,"I will make it legal."
Shmi Skywalker,"There was no father. I carried him, I gave birth, I raised him. I can't explain what happened."
Shmi Skywalker,"What does your heart tell you?"
Qui-Gon Jinn,"There's always a bigger fish."
Jar Jar Binks,"Mesa called Jar Jar Binks, mesa your humble servant!"
Jar Jar Binks,"Ex-squeeze me, but the mostest safest place would be Gunga City. 'Tis where I grew up. 'Tis a hidden city."
Jar Jar Binks,"Hmm... yousa point is well seen. Dis way, hurry!"
Jar Jar Binks,"Yousa should follow me now, okeeday? My warning yous: Gungans no like outsiders. Don't 'spect a warm welcome."
Jar Jar Binks,"How wuude!"
Jar Jar Binks,"Count me outta dis one. Better dead here than deader in the Core-- Ye Gods, whatta mesa sayin'?!"
Jar Jar Binks,"You'd say, "boom de gasa"... den crashded da boss's heyblibber... den banished."
Jar Jar Binks,"Uh-oh! Biiiiiig Goober fish!"
Jar Jar Binks,"Monsters out dere, leakin in here, all sinkin an no power? When are yousa tinkin' wesa in trouble?!"
Jar Jar Binks,"Oh, maxi big da Force..."
Jar Jar Binks,"Mesa hatin' crunchin'. Dat's the last thing mesa want."
Jar Jar Binks,"Dissen gonna be bery messy! Me no watchin!"
Jar Jar Binks,"Gungans no dyin' withouta fight. Wesa warriors. Wesa got a grand army. That's why you no likin' us, mesa thinks."
Jar Jar Binks,"Icky, icky goo!"
Padme Amidala,"I was not elected to watch my people suffer and die while you discuss this invasion in a committee!"
Chancellor Palpatine,"And you, young Skywalker; we shall watch your career with great interest."
Qui-Gon Jinn,"Remember, concentrate on the moment. Feel, don't think. Trust your instincts."
Qui-Gon Jinn,"I can only protect you, I cannot fight a war for you."
Yoda,"Always two there are, no more no less. A master and an apprentice."
Jar Jar Binks,"Mesa day startin pretty okee-day with a brisky morning munchy, then BOOM! Gettin very scared and grabbin that Jedi and POW! Mesa here! Mesa gettin' very very scared!"
Jar Jar Binks,"Yipe! How wude."
C-3PO,"I've had the most peculiar dream."
Yoda,"Mmm. Lost a planet, Master Obi-Wan has. How embarrassing. How embarrassing."
Yoda,"Truly wonderful, the mind of a child is."
Obi-Wan Kenobi,"Why do I get the feeling you're going to be the death of me?"
Anakin Skywalker,"You're the closest thing I have to a father."
Yoda,"The shroud of the dark side has fallen. Begun, the clone war has."
Anakin Skywalker,"When I'm around you, my mind is no longer my own."
Mace Windu,"This party's over."
Anakin Skywalker,"I killed them. I killed them all. They're dead, every single one of them. And not just the men, but the women and the children, too. They're like animals, and I slaughtered them like animals. I HATE THEM."
Anakin Skywalker,"I wasn't strong enough to save you mum. I wasn't strong enough, but I promise I won't fail again."
C-3PO,"This is such a drag."
C-3PO,"I'm quite beside myself."
Padme Amidala,"We live in a real world, Ani. Come back to it."
Obi-Wan Kenobi,"Be mindful of your thoughts Anakin. They'll betray you."
Padme Amidala,"I'm not afraid to die. I've been dying a little bit each day since you came back into my life."
Padme Amidala,"I love you."
Padme Amidala,"I think our lives are about to be destroyed anyway. I truly... deeply... love you and before we die I want you to know."
C-3PO,"Die, Jedi dogs. Oh...what did I say?"
Anakin Skywalker,"From the moment I met you, all those years ago, not a day has gone by when I haven't thought of you. And now that I'm with you again... I'm in agony. The closer I get to you, the worse it gets. The thought of not being with you- I can't breath. I'm haunted by the kiss that you should never have given me. My heart is beating... hoping that kiss will not become a scar. You are in my very soul, tormenting me... what can I do? I will do anything you ask."
Padme Amidala,"All mentors have a way of seeing more of our faults than we would like. It's the only way we grow."
Padme Amidala,"Sometimes there are things no one can fix."
Yoda,"The dark side clouds everything. Impossible to see, the future is."
C-3PO,"A battle? There must be some mistake! I'm programmed for etiquette, not destruction!"
Yoda,"Pain, suffering, death I feel. Something terrible has happened. Young Skywalker is in pain. Terrible pain."
Jar Jar Binks,"Senators. Dellow feligates..."
Obi-Wan Kenobi,"And don't forget, she's a politician, and they're not to be trusted."
Queen Jamillia,"We must keep our faith in the Republic. The day we stop believing democracy can work is the day we lose it."
Padme Amidala,"Let's pray that day never comes."
